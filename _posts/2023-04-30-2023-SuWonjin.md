title:  "Exploring The Conflict Between Over-Simplified Design and Diverse Community Needs 
in Small Parks in Queens, New York"

### Introduction

This report examines the conflict between simplified design and diverse community needs in small parks along the 7 Line in Queens, New York. GIS and data research analyze spatial patterns and characteristics of small parks in Queens and demographic data from surrounding areas. We want to discover that Queens' many small parks are designed with a simplistic, generic approach that may not adequately reflect the diverse needs and identities of the surrounding communities.

Our research anticipates several key findings. 


First, Queens' smaller parks are disproportionately located in low-income and minority neighborhoods, which may reflect a lack of investment and interest from the city government. 


Second, there is a significant mismatch between the demographic characteristics of the surrounding neighborhoods and the design characteristics of small-scale parks, such as playgrounds and sports facilities, that need to meet the needs and interests of residents. 


Finally, lacking public investment and community involvement in designing and maintaining smaller parks can worsen a conflict between simplified design and diverse community needs. 


To start, we would like to use one of the small parks as an example to illustrate:

Just like this small park, there are many others alongside the 7 Line in Queens, suffering the same fate of generalization and monotonous design while being situated in culturally, socially and economically diverse neighborhoods.

The method behind our research is guided by the two forces behinds the management and ownership of these parks: the New York City Parks and Recreation Department and the local community. For each of these park, we are looking at its government and governance, both quantitatively and qualitatively. From mapping out capital project investments done by Parks and Recs in Queens to different languages spoken by people living in Queens. The projects attempts to extrapolate and put into form the culture at each of these parks or the lack-thereof.
