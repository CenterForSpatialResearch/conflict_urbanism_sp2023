title:  "Exploring The Conflict Between Over-Simplified Design and Diverse Community Needs 
in Small Parks in Queens, New York"

### Introduction

This report examines the conflict between simplified design and diverse community needs in small parks along the 7 Line in Queens, New York. GIS and data research analyze spatial patterns and characteristics of small parks in Queens and demographic data from surrounding areas. We want to discover that Queens' many small parks are designed with a simplistic, generic approach that may not adequately reflect the diverse needs and identities of the surrounding communities.

Our research anticipates several key findings. 


First, Queens' smaller parks are disproportionately located in low-income and minority neighborhoods, which may reflect a lack of investment and interest from the city government. 


Second, there is a significant mismatch between the demographic characteristics of the surrounding neighborhoods and the design characteristics of small-scale parks, such as playgrounds and sports facilities, that need to meet the needs and interests of residents. 


Finally, lacking public investment and community involvement in designing and maintaining smaller parks can worsen a conflict between simplified design and diverse community needs. 


To start, we would like to use one of the small parks as an example to illustrate:

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
 1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
