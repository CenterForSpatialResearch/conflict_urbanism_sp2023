#### INTRODUCTION  

We are interested in mapping three main factors in Svalbard related to time and producing a projective overlay that interrogates how these factors interact in the future, through the lens of a climactic timescale:

1. Time of Climate Change
1. Time of Industries and Resources
1. Time of Oddities and Border Anomalies

#### PROJECTION OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Currently experts from the Norwegian Polar Institute are among those who calculate that the Arctic Circle is heating six times faster than the global average, making it the fastest warming place on Earth.The temperature has jumped 4 degrees celsius in the past 50 years and there are now many wildlife and human lives struggling to survive. The melting of the arctic is diminishing local fauna’s hunting grounds, leading them, mostly polar bears, to explore built up areas. The rising temperatures are causing thawing of frozen grounds which also increases the risk of avalanches during the winter and mudslides during the summer in the Arctic community. As glaciers in the Arctic thaw it becomes more feasible to extract natural resources from previously frozen waterways

#### PROJECTION OF INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES

Russia and Norway have renewed a current affair over the status of waters around the archipelago of Svalbard. The countries have recently exchanged diplomatic blows over whether Russian fishers are entitled to fish freely in the area, without controls exercised by Norway's authorities. Svalbard contains a “Global Seed Vault” which acts as a secure backup facility for the world’s crop diversity. The Seed Vault provides long-term storage of duplicates of seeds conserved in genebanks around the world, which will provide security of the world’s food supply as catastrophic events occur in the future.

#### PROJECTION OF ODDITIES AND BORDER ANOMALIES

The coal-rich archipelago came to Norway through the Svalbard Treaty in 1920. The treaty was signed by numerous countries which granted Norway “full and absolute sovereignty” over the entire landmass. However, Norway’s sovereignty over Svalbard is limited and the islands remain legally distinct from the mainland. Norwegian tax laws do not apply to Svalbard and immigration rules compromise Norwegian dominion. Several foreign communities have taken advantage of Svalbard’s open borders, especially those of Russian descent. A Russian state-owned coal company maintains Svalbard’s second largest settlement, Barentsburg. Coal mining is not very profitable but requires assistance from Moscow. Thais form the second largest foreign group that reside in Svalbard. Many miners that work in the coal mines left on vacation to come back with wives from Thailand. The local supermarkets are said to now have Asian corners with numerous Asian commodities for sale. Svalbard does not presently have an easy migration option. Welfare is not provided and anyone without a job and a place to stay can be summarily deported. Svalbard also lacks local democracy. The governor, who also acts as the police chief, is appointed by Oslo. Building regulations are extremely strict and most land is devoted to nature reserves. Many other oddities see Svalbard as a potential “European Freestate”. Apparently it is illegal to not carry a gun outside of certain settlements.
Svalbard acts as the home of numerous significant arctic research stations, owned by numerous countries around the world, one notably being India.


 1. use two spaces in front to indent   

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
 1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
