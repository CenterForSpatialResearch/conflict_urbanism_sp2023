With Ukraine at the forefront of the international geopolitical discourse, our team has committed to investigate the continued conflict, examining more closely on how the Russian invasion has  systematically targeted Ukrainian history, culture and identity.

It has meticulously destroyed hundreds of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites - to its museums, monuments, places of religious and spiritual worship, libraries, and buildings of historical and/or artistic interest. These cultural artifacts - manifested through art, literature, music, dance, religion, and other forms - archive a people’s beliefs, customs, mythology, knowledge, traditions, and perspectives on the past, present, and future. As Robert Behavn said in his book, The Destruction of Memory, “every nation legitimizes its existence through its creativity - when evidence of this creativity is suppressed, piece by piece, the very identity of a nation is gradually lost.” The continual destruction of Ukraine is a colonialist strategy embraced by Russian President Vladimir Putin who has vehemently denied Ukraine’s legitimacy as a sovereign nation, even stating that a distinct Ukrainian history, language and culture “do not exist”. Our project aims to validate Ukrainian culture and communicate the narrative of how it is being fought on the front lines of the brutal war through forensic and visual investigative work.

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2023/rebolino_images/rebolino_world_atmpshere.jpg)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://verenakrappitz.github.io/maps/index.html#5/43.961/33.267" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
