#### INTRODUCTION  

Previous studies have commonly correlated night light as a proxy of population density and economic activity indicators (Liu et al., 2021, Elvidge et al., 2007, Elvidge et al., 2012, Zhao et al., 2019). However, relying on nighttime satellite imagery to analyze human activities can overlook areas that are populated but lack infrastructure. Our project seeks to counter this approach by examining the "dark" spots on the nighttime light map and identifying anomalies in population distribution. Specifically, we will compare nighttime light satellite imagery with building footprint datasets, informal mobility network datasets, and census grid counts produced by governments and researchers worldwide. This comparison will enable us to reveal global patterns and stories of places with people but a lack of infrastructural lights at night, with a focus on cities in Africa.

Remote sensing of nighttime light emissions offers a unique perspective for investigations into human behaviors.

**Dominant Narrative of Nighttime Light Satellite Imagery**

Previous studies have commonly correlated night light as a proxy of population density and economic activity indicators.

- “(N)ightlight intensities as a proxy of **economic activity** degrees to estimate **county-level GDP**” -Liu et al., 2021
- “Remotely-sensed anthropogenic lighting signals and their spatial variations at night provide us with an efficient proxy **measure of the demographic** and **economic related activities** during urbanization and regional development” -Zhao et al., 2019
- “This data can reveal **local context** and quantify **relative economic performance** - especially in places where official information is unavailable, unreliable, or out-of-date.” -Foster and Lechler 2022
- “Multi-spectral low-light imaging data would be … potentially a stronger predictor of variables such as ambient **population density** and **economic activity**.” -Elvidge et al., 2007


Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
