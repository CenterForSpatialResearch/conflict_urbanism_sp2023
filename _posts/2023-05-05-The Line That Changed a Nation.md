### INTRODUCTION  

Nicosia, Cyprus is the world's last divided capital city. The decades-long stalemate between Greek-Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriots over the UN-controlled Green Line—also known as the Buffer Zone, Neutral Zone, Dead Zone, and No Man's Land—has resulted in politically and socially charged mappings of the island. A simple search for "map of Cyprus" yields dozens of interpretations of ethnic and geopolitical divisions at the scale of the country, with additional nuances coming to light at the scale of the Green Line. This project provides a brief overview of the events that led to the drawing of the Green Line, the perspectives from which the country and the Green Line are mapped, and the implications of these cartographic representations.

### BACKGROUND  

The events that led to the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus are complex, span decades of conflict, and involve atrocities and conflict spurred both by Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots. The scope of this project focuses on the spatial and representational consequences of the events of the summer of 1974.

**The Island of Cyprus** 

Cyprus is a small island in the Mediterranean Sea located south of Turkey and west of Israel and is home to both Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots. Ethnically, Greek-Cypriots compose the majority of the population—before the war, Turkish-Cypriots lived throughout the island, generally clustered together with other Turkish-Cypriots. Importantly, both ethnic groups lived together throughout the entirety of the island before the first conflict began. 

**Independence and a Brief Period of Peace**

The nuances of Cyprus's history and political control by the Ottoman Empire, Greece, and England go beyond the scope of this project—for the sake of brevity and to keep the focus on the aftermath of the invasion, this summary will begin in 1960 when Cyprus became an independent republic, free of British rule (although two large British bases remain on the island to this day). Cyprus's new constitution allocated separate control to Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot municipalities in an attempt to satisfy both communities and prevent conflict; however, just four years later these concessions proved unsuccessful. By 1964, armed conflict between Greeks and Turks rose to a level of alarm that required the UN to intervene by sending peacekeeping forces to the island. To this day, the UN remains in Cyprus in one of its longest-ever peacekeeping missions.

**Drawing the Green Line**  

Fighting escalated to a point at which Cypriot forces accepted putting troops under British control. British Major General Young embarked on a set of discussions and concessions with Greek and Turkish National Contingents. Attempting to appease both sides, he began drawing a line on one of his maps of Cyprus to separate the Greek south from the Turkish north. General Young's selection of a green pencil was no random choice—blue and red were out of the question given that they were associated both with the British flag (the former enemy) and with the Greek and Turkish flags. Green was associated with military fortifications and was the most 'neutral' color choice. General Young went back and forth with Greek and Turkish representatives, erasing and re-drawing the line until both sides were in agreement. And just like that, the Green Line was born, and a country divided. Although the Green Line was meant to be a temporary step to restore peace between the two sides, it became a permanent and impassable part of the island after the Turkish Invasion of 1974.

**The Aftermath**  

Over 200,000 Cypriots were displaced from their own homes and became refugees in their own country overnight. Given the continued division of the island and the emotional trauma, most of them have never gone back to their own homes. The division of the capital city of Nicosia creates a painful and delicate tension in that some Greek-Cypriots have lived less than a mile from their old homes and memories, yet are remain refugees. It wasn't until 2003 that border crossings opened between the two sides. Even after the crossings opened, many decided not to go to the Turkish side. To this day, in order to cross to the Turkish side, Greek-Cypriots are required to show their passport at crossing points.

### THEN AND NOW  

**Before the 1974 Invasion**

**Today**

Land divided, land untouched. Much of the territory within the Green Line has been left completely untouched since 1974. Nicosia's airport was set to become a travel hub for the Mediterranean and Middle East, yet now sits abandoned and in decay.

### MAPPING PERSPECTIVES 

Original maps by the author to underscore spatial and political representations of Cyprus at the country- and city-scale. A careful selection of the 'fill' of the Green Line in these maps as Lefkara lace—recognized by UNESCO as part of the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity—is made to underscore the persistence of Cypriot culture and the strength of its people despite the unimaginable suffering endured being a refugee in one's own country.

### Conclusion  

Nearly 50 years have passed since the invasion and subsequent fracture of the island of Cyprus. While tensions have eased and crossing points between the two sides have opened, reunification talks throughout the years have all ended in stalemates. Sentiments among the younger generations on both sides support a unified Cyprus and a future living together in harmony, yet politicians' agendas prevail again and again. Despite the seemingly never-ending stalemate, it is critical that the ways in which the division of the island is represented have a seat at the table during these talks. We often assume maps are objective sources of truth, and final products not to be changed; however, under the circumstances of the Green Line in which the nuances of mapping become contested geopolitical grounds, the maps themselves become subjective documentation of the world we want to see.
