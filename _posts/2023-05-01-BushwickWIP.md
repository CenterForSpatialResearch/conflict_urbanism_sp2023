#### Introduction: Who Made The New Bushwick?

![123 Melrose](/conflict_urbanism_sp2023/images/bushwick/123melrose.jpg)

Real estate development has been strongly tied to overall economic conditions. To stimulate economic growth after the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee introduced the longest and lowest Federal Funds Rate, at about 0.1%, since 1954, from November 2008 until November 2015. With extremely low-interest rates, new development boomed nationwide when the market recovered from 2010. Furthermore, following Trump's Opportunity Zones in Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, many new constructions were initiated in underdeveloped areas signaling large-scale urban revitalization was underway. Bushwick is an example of the tide of the 2010s real estate boom.

In a shrinking regional economy, urban revitalization is crucial to bring new life and stimulate capital growth. Conflict emerges, however, when an influx of capital and new residents replaces the previous under-represented enclaves. Driven by favorable market conditions and proximity to the already matured Williamsburg’s market, Bushwick’s development has outgrown many other neighborhoods in New York City in recent years. Currently, in Bushwick, a new residential building with a piano keyboard exterior stands on Evergreen Avenue; a Tesla is locked in a backyard with 24-hour surveillance on Cooper Street, scaffoldings and work-in-progress signs block the sidewalk on Broadway; irregular chunks of complexes with glass balconies duplicate on Melrose street. The project seeks to discover who plays the major role in gentrifying Bushwick and what is the relationship between the owner and the new building. By looking at the permit issuance data from 2008 to 2022, the project hopes to discover the development trends in Bushwick since the last recession. Who made the new Bushwick?
 
#### The Developer’s Town: The Cluster Effect of The Owner’s Address

![Owner's Address Cluster](/conflict_urbanism_sp2023/images/bushwick/hhl_map1.jpg)

To understand where the owners came from and which companies developed Bushwick, I looked into the registered owner’s addresses from the Department of Building data that indicated their true business addresses.

The majority of the owners are from Bushwick’s adjacent neighborhoods: South Williamsburg, Bed-Stuy-Crown-Heights area, and Bushwick itself. If we zoom out further, Jamaica in Queens, Borough Park in Brooklyn, FiDi and Midtown in Manhattan, and Great Neck in Long Island also have a significant number of owners. The cluster effect might link to the real estate industry condensing neighborhoods that have multiple real estate development companies and property management companies in close proximity. Specific ethnic groups and families might share the same focus in real estate development, like the contribution from Jewish developers throughout the history of New York. In Bushwick, more than two-thirds of the owners are from South Williamsburg, which is a traditionally known Orthodox Jewish neighborhood. It not only has a close proximity to Bushwick but also congregates real estate business. Borough Park, Great Neck, and some parts of Crown Heights share similar characteristics.

The map shows the spatial relationship between the owner’s address and Bushwick’s new building.

#### Top Owner by Name

![Top Owner's Address](/conflict_urbanism_sp2023/images/bushwick/hhl_map2.jpg)

There are 299 total individual owners to develop 536 new buildings from 2008-2022. Most owners only have one building in the period. There are 12 outliers calculated by the IQR method. Sorted descendingly, which are Bob Michaeli (27), Louis Handler (12), Mendel Gold (11), Boaz Gilad (11), Timothy Joseph (10), Shampa Chanda (10), Richard Lopez (10), Leopold Kaufman (9), Sal Mendolia (6), Joel Braver (6), Haim Levy (6), Gabriel Grunblatt (6). 

They altogether developed 124 new buildings, which took about 23.1% of the entire Bushwick’s new buildings.

Based on the permit issuance, Bob Michaeli (Robert Michaeli) is the top owner of Bushwick’s new buildings. Bob Michaeli is the project manager at Urban View Development Group Inc., a South Williamsburg-based real estate firm. The second top owner is NYC HPD which is represented by Timothy Joseph and Shampa Chanda.

The map shows the top 12 owners’s (outlier) location. The color ones indicate they have multiple owner’s addresses.

*Bob Michaeli's Urban View Development Group Inc. is registered at 101 Broadway in South Williamsburg. The company's name doesn't show up in the dictionary. Based on Google reviews, it is likely associated with Prospect Management at the bottom left.*

#### Top Owner’s Address

![Top Shared Owner's Address](/conflict_urbanism_sp2023/images/bushwick/hhl_map3.jpg)

There are 291 unique owner’s (business) addresses compared to 299 individual owners for 536 new buildings. It indicates there are shared owner’s addresses at the same buildings. There are two possible scenarios. First, the shared address has PO boxes for different LLCs. Second, there are different fee developers for the same real estate firm, and they all use the real estate firm’s address as the owner's address. 12 top owner’s addresses (outliers) developed 161 buildings, which took around 30% of the entire Bushwick’s new buildings. The top shared owner’s address is 199 Lee Avenue in South Williamsburg. 37 new building LLCs are based in this address.

The map shows the top owners' (outlier) addresses. The blue color indicates they have multiple owners at the same address.

There are 152 builders, including architects or contractors, for 536 new buildings. The top builders (outliers), sorted descendingly, are Gerald J Caliendo (52), Bahram Tehrani (31), Wu (Woody) Chen (30), Olabanji Awosika (28), Diego B Aguilera (21), Suresh Manchanda (19), Charles Mallea (16), Boaz Golani (15), Robert Bianchini (14), Aryeh Siegel (10), and Douglas Pulaksi (10). 45.9% of the new buildings were built by the listed builders. Gerald J Caliendo tops the chart by building 52 new buildings in Bushwick.

Bushwick's development provides a snapshot of recent economic trends. Following COVID-19, the surge of new developments seems to have slowed down considerably, although Bushwick still has more construction activity than the city average. The surplus of new housing in outer boroughs appears to be insufficient to meet the saturated demand city-wide. The project aims to uncover who initially develops and owns Bushwick's new buildings. The financing structure from financial institutions, equity models, and subsequent buying and selling patterns may have a greater impact on true ownership in the development. However, the capital structure of real estate development, complexity of gentrification, and changes in economic and demographic characteristics in the neighborhood are beyond the scope of this project.

#### Methodology

It is important to address the methodology for data collection and analysis in the project.

For data collection, first, the primary data was downloaded from NYC Open Data, DOB Permit Issuance. I selected community district “304,” which is equal to the neighborhood of Bushwick. Then, I filtered only “NB,” which meant new building in the permit type column, and the permit sequence to “01” to avoid any duplication. Second, in order to fill out the missing data, which was mostly in the owner's address column, I used several websites like MSCI Real Capital Analytics, OpenCorporates, and Realty Hop to find the owner’s (company) address. Since most of the building permits had either owner’s names or owner’s business names, it was possible to find out the owner’s (company) address by cross-referencing. Third, to add and find out the architect or contractor for the building, I created a new column and used Market Proof, the Real Deal, YIMBY, and Street Easy website to find information. Finally, I used Python and OpenStreetMap API to find the coordinates of each owner’s address. The data set was ready to use for mapping and network analysis at this stage.

There were three main parts to my analysis. First was mapping. To calculate clusters for mapping, I converted owner’s address coordinates into XY points in ArcGIS. Then, I used clustering in an aggregation function to make dynamic point clusters. Since the owner’s points had apparent aggregation, the dynamic point clusters were enough to distinguish where the clusters were located in which neighborhoods. It was unnecessary to count how many points were in the precise neighborhood boundary. Second, to calculate outliers for owner’s name, owner’s address, and contractor, I used the interquartile range method. Due to the spikes that caused non-normal distribution in the data set, the IQR method was more ideal to find outliers than the standard distribution method. The formula for the IQR method was: Q3 + 3 IQR. Third was network analysis. For network analysis, I used an R script to convert the focused columns into nodes. Then, I calculated the degree of vertex. Finally, I plotted the graph as a tree layout.
