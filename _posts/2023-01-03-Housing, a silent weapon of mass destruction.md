#### INTRODUCTION

On February 6, 2023, a severe earthquake with a Richter scale reading of 7.7 devastated Turkey and Syria, killing more than 50,000 people and displacing millions across more than a dozen cities. According to the World Bank, the damage is estimated to be worth $34 billion.
The number of fatalities and property losses from this earthquake has eclipsed all previous records, exposing the cause of this immense catastrophe - **HOUSING**.

Since 2005, several places worldwide (as shown in img 1) have experienced similar events to Bhuj and Turkey, with a common factor being the construction of soft storey structures. Despite the known risk associated with such buildings, they continue to be built, and little action has been taken to address the existing such structures. The majority of these structures can be attributed to corrupt practices, with the primary motivation being the pursuit of rapid financial gain. The devastating earthquakes in Gujarat in 2001 and Turkey and Syria in 2023 have highlighted the destructive power of poorly constructed housing, which has resulted in numerous fatalities and extensive property damage. Itâ€™s important to note that most of the highly collapsible buildings have been in areas that consist of economically and socially vulnerable communities.

Soft story constructions, so named because the first floor is substantially less stiff than the stories above, are vulnerable to damage in earthquake-prone zones due to massive unreinforced apertures. These areas are typically used for parking or other commercial reasons. Such constructions are far less able to withstand the lateral forces (forces that push a structure side to side) generated by earthquakes if they are not adequately designed. When the first floor collapses, the upper floors collapse on top of it, crushing anything beneath, commonly known as the pancake construction. .
Despite what we know about the behavior of soft story structures in earthquake zones, why do we keep building them? Why are housing policy based on short-term commercial objectives rather than long-term social and environmental concerns? 


#### Case of Ahmedabad, Gujarat 

On January 26, 2001, an earthquake in Gujarat, India's Kachchh district, massacred over 35,000 people and significantly damaged the state's housing stock. More than 1 million houses either needed extensive repairs or were [destroyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDos6WCsP1Y).

### Understanding Geographies 


According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, India has five seismic zones, with Zone V being the most severe. The seismically active Kachchh region, on the western end of the Indian subcontinent, accounts for around 22% of Gujarat State's (45,930 km2) total land area, is in Zone V, and suffered the most substantial damage. Among the Kachchh towns and cities that suffered severe damage were Bhuj, Bhachau, Rapar, Anjar, and Gandhidham even though the IS 4326: 1993 "Earthquake Resistant Design and Construction of Structures -Code of Practice" outlines a comprehensive list of standards and laws that control the earthquake-resistant design of buildings in India. It's important to keep in mind that these codes are just recommendations, not prerequisites. Several other areas of the state were also severely damaged by the earthquake, most notably Ahmedabad, a large urban Centre in Gujarat that was in seismic Zone III and about 300 kilometers to the east of Bhuj.
The strength of ground motion would not be anticipated to be strong at such a distance, but despite this, 70 multistory residential buildings collapsed, killing 750 people with heights that ranged from the ground plus four to ground plus ten levels. One thing all seventy buildings had in common was that they were all reinforced concrete-framed buildings with an open first story, inadequate column-beam junction detailing, and average construction quality.



[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
 1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
